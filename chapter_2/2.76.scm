; General description:

; Explicit dispath:
; adding new type - pain, need to add conditions to all genetic methods
; adding new operation - easy, just one condition
; Main advatange: easy and straight-foward to code

; Message-passing
; addding new type - easy breezy
; adding new operation - pain, need to change all the old code
; Main advantage: easy to maintain

; Data-directed:
; adding new type - not such easy as message-passing
; adding new operation - easy
; Main advantage: scalability

; answer: Data-directed

; Which would be most appropriate for a system in which new operations must often be added?
